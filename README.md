#RockPaperScissor is a game that I created using python programming language.
I used many python features like python libraries eg random for computer to make a choice using AI.
I then used input() function to take input from the player.
Then I used conditional statements to determine win, loss, and tie conditions by feeding the correct logical conditions to the conditional statements.
And after all the above mentioned tasks, I accomplished the desired result.
